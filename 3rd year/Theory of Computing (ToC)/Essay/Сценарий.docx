Introduction
In 1959 Michael Rabin from MIT formulated probabilistic automata and in 1963 he have written article about this.
The probabilistic automata is a generalization of finite state automata. The difference is a state transition function. So all finite state automatas is probabilistic automata

Consider it more detailed.
Firstly, consider Finite State Automata or FSA.
FSA by definition is set of sigma,S, S zero, F and M. Let consider all parts more detailed:
Sigma is the input alphabet
S is a set of states
s zero is an initial state
M is the state-transition function such that exists transition node to node (both from S) by this character from sigma
F is the set of final states.

Consider simple example:
We starts from s zero. After it we can transite to s one   by delta one or to s two  by delta three. Also we can transite from s one  to s two by delta two. So we are doing it until input string ends. If we string ends in s two as a final state then string is accepted else not.

Now let's consider probabilistic automata. It's extension of FSA. 
So p.a. is set of sigma, s, s0,M and F.
Sigma, s, s0 and F are the same.
But M defines differently:
M is a function from 2 variables (state and input character). Result of M is vector with n+1 length which includes probabilities of transition from node s to
node s i by character sigma. Of course, every probabilities more than 0 and sum of all probabilities from node s equals 1.



Now let's consider input string probability calculus.
Assume x is input string then x is concatenation of sigmas from 1 till m.
For probability calculus, we define 2-dimensional matrixes A from sigma by following formula.

Let's draw A. It's a matrix with size n+1 by n+1. 
Then we can calculate matrix of probabilities for full string as multiplication of A from epsilon and every sigma.

A from epsilon is the identity matrix:


Let's consider an example:
We have following automata.
Assume we have input string x as '210', s0 is the initial state and s1 is the final state.



Defines matrixes for transitions:
Calculate matrixes multiplication. So probabilities for x is this matrix.

S zero is initial state.S1 is the final state. So probability of x is a s0 s1.
So we can calculate probabilities for every probabilistic automata like sum of probabilities by following formula.

But we didn't consider question of accepted strings. For answering on this question exists cut-point lambda.
A cut-point is a real number from 0 till 1.
If x is input string by alphabet and probability of x more than lambda.
For our example, if the lambda is ..,  the 210 is accepted, if so..., then not accepted.


Intensive development of the theory of probabilistic automata in 60-70th years of last century created sevetal types of application.
So schemes of probabilistic automata are applying:

1. To determine the possibilities of algorithmic systems
2. In the design of discrete systems displaying a statistically regular random behaviour
3. In the simulation of adaptive behaviour, e.g robots, living organisms, etc.

Let's consider one of above applications namely method of statistical modeling:
Consider the following situation:
Exists an intersection of two roads which include two traffic lights respectively.
So we can define probabilistic automata by following schema. Where q0 is the initial state (first road are opened), q1 is another state and P
P defines by statistic of movement.



So we can model different statistical situations.

Other applications can be readed in our survey.
In this video we describe main points of probabilistic automata, basic definitions and applications.
